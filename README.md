# codeX
#### Code eXperiences.

CodeX is my personal repository for trying out tools in programming: languages, frameworks,
libraries, functions, etc., untethered from specific projects.

CodeX serves as both as a sandbox and a notebook for eventual future reference. Its main goals are 
to gather knowledge, apply it and ensure the work is synced across different devices and operating 
systems.

### Structure

Experiments will be organized in folders according to their language.
Languages included so far are Python and R.

### Disclaimer

Do not take code here too seriously. The repository is, by design, eXperimental.
